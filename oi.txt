mas como voce vai meu amigo voce acha que hoje vai chover, quem sabe chover sangue? slayer e uma bosta, tipo so tem uma os duas musicas boas, o resto e bem lixo
mas voltando ao assunto espero que isso funfe direito agora uma palavra bem grande bom pelo visto existe um problema com palavras vem grandes, nao sei pq, mas voltando
a falar de musica megadeth e muito melhor que slayer, metallica ainda e metallica mas mega e bom pra caralho, lembra que anida tem que ver as palavras grandes, isso e um problema
do buffer e tbm tem que fazer os comentarios, e a lista ligada e talves so te um merge e nao dois, pra lista diferente blz muitas
para jeito diferente pro VD e meio tosco, o problema com palavras grandes foi resolvido yayyyyyy, ainda falta A LO O, LD A e O e AB Oca
VAMOS LEMBRAR QUE DA PRA PASSAR A TABELA PRA UM VETOR E ORD ELE, INEFICIENTE, TALEVEZ, MAS FODASE.

End of passion play, crumbling away
Im your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, its sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master, master

Master, master
Wheres the dreams that Ive been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries, fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
