End of passion play, crumbling away
Im your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, its sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master, master

Master, master
Wheres the dreams that Ive been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries, fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you cant see a thing
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause Ill hear you scream
Master, master

Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who cares

They, they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true, sad but true

You, you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You, you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed

Do, do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do, do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true, sad but true

I'm your dreams, I'm your eyes, I'm your pain
I'm your dreams, I'm your eyes, I'm your pain
You know it's sad but true

Hate, I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay, pay the price
Pay for nothing's fair

Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey, I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you, sad but true

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me

Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse

I can’t remember anything
Can’t tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I’m waking up, I cannot see
That there’s not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it’s much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can’t look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I’ll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I’m just one
Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell
